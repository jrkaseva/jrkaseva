- 👋 Hi, I’m @jrkaseva, an IT-student at JYU
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things, especially algorithms and mathematical things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything. C# is my favourite but now trying to learn C and Java. I want to learn React and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. Mostly I want experience in projects that resemble real work.
- 📫 How to reach me: we will see :)
