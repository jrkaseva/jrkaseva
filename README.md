- 👋 Hi, I’m Joakim Kaseva (@jrkaseva), an IT-student at JYU
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things, especially algorithms and mathematical things. 
     I find both frontend and backend development interesting along with cybersecurity and game development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything. Java and Python are my favourite languages but now I'm trying to learn C and JS. I want to learn React.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. Mostly I want experience in projects that resemble real work.
